DealMe
=======
DealMe is an Android app that lets you find deals close by to you!

It utilizes the Yellow Pages API and your device's location to send the closest deals to your Pebble Smartwatch. It auto updates so that when you move locations to a closer deal, you will be notified. Currently not available on the Play Store.

Developed at the 2014 McHacks at McGill University by Vishal Mathur, Arthur Yan
